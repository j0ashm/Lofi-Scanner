# Radio-fi
A webapp that combines Lofi music with public ATC/Public Safety scanners. Written mostly as a practice end-to-end practice project, but also because Lofi + radio traffic makes for very good background noise while you work! ðŸ¥³

Standard React build/run guidelines apply here.

A demo of this project as it progresses is available [here](https://radiofi.netlify.app/).

# To-Do
- [ ] Music rotation
- [ ] Add more feeds (Hopefully, this can be done via a web-scraper rather than a manual config file)

# Known Bugs
- [ ] Loading a feed takes ~15s
- [ ] Some feeds seem to never load
